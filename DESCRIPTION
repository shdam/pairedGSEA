Description: pairedGSEA makes it simple to run a paired Differential
    Gene Expression (DGE) and Differencital Gene Splicing (DGS) analysis.
    The package allows you to store intermediate results for further
    investiation, if desired.
    pairedGSEA comes with a wrapper function for running an
    Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) and functionalities for
    plotting the results.

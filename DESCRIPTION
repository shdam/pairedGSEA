Description: pairedGSEA makes it simple to run a paired Differential Gene Expression (DGE) and Differencital Gene Splicing (DGS) analysis.
  The package allows you to store intermediate results for further investiation, if desired.
  pairedGSEA comes with a wrapper function for running an Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) and functionalities for plotting the results.
